Continuous testing helper, adapted from [1], but which makes no
assumption about what tests you might want to run continuously while
developing.  Any command supplied to the script will be run once and
then repeated any time the code in the current working directory
changes.  You may wish to edit the IGNORE_* tuples to suit your
particular setup.

Note that ANY command you supply the script will be run, so be
careful.  You have been warned!

Installation:
  ./setup.py install

Usage examples:
  conttest nosetests
  conttest 'nosetests -q && pep8 -r .'

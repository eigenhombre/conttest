Continuous testing helper, adapted from [1], but which makes no
assumption about what tests you might want to run continuously while
developing.  For more information, see
[this blog post](http://zerolib.com/continuous-testing.html).

**Any command supplied to the script will be run once and then
repeated any time a file in the current working directory changes,**
except for files excluded using `.conttest-excludes` as described below.

**See also** [2]

Note that ANY command you supply the script will be run, so be
careful.  You have been warned!

### Installation

    ./setup.py install  # from source
or

    pip install conttest  # use sudo if installing globally

### Usage examples

    conttest nosetests
    conttest 'nosetests -q && pep8 -r .'

Placing a file `.conttest-excludes` in the current working directory
will exclude subdirectories, e.g.:

    .svn$
    .git
    build
    vendor/elastic*
    install

will match files against the listed regular expressions and skip checking
for changes in those directories.  This can save quite a bit of time and CPU
during normal operation.
